# repro-materials
The following links are pointers to materials that we would need for our implementations

## BGPStream:
https://bgpstream.caida.org/: This is the link for the BGPStream

## Routeviews:
https://www.routeviews.org/routeviews/: Routeviews is one of the Route Collectors that we will use for collecting BGP

## RIPE RIS:
https://www.ripe.net/analyse/internet-measurements/routing-information-service-ris: RIPE RIS is also a BGP data collector with lots of Sub-features.
  ### RIS Raw Data:
  https://www.ripe.net/analyse/internet-measurements/routing-information-service-ris/archive/ris-raw-data: This is RIS raw data
  ### RIS Live Data:
  https://ris-live.ripe.net/: Accessing RIS live data
  ### RIPE Atlas:
  https://atlas.ripe.net/: This is measure the rnet connectivity and reachability and also a product of RIPE.
  ### RIPE Stats
  https://stat.ripe.net/about/: Providing open data and insights for Internet resources.
  
## Looking Glasses (Traceroute):
datahttp://www.traceroute.org/#Looking%20Glass: These are various looking glasses that also does similar things but with some drawbacks.

## BGPmon:
https://www.bgpmon.net/: BGPmon is also another tool that are commonly used in this research.

## Internet Health Report:
https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/: The Internet Health Report (IHR) is also another useful tool that we can harness and used by one of the selected studies for the reproducibility studies.
  ### Internet Health Report Archieves:
  https://ihr-archive.iijlab.net/: The IHR archieves, it entails daily dumbs of various kinds of data that we would be using during the studies. 
  
  ### AS Hegonomy
  https://ihr-archive.iijlab.net/ihr/hegemony/: The AS hegonomy is an achieve in above link and also used in **BGP Hijacking Classification** paper.


## Additional Materials: 
These are not urgent for now but I believe are resources that could be beneficial for the future.

pktlab.github.io: I would be interested to know about the implementation and various functions of the packetLab tool

### RIPE Labs
https://labs.ripe.net/contributing-to-ripe-labs/?pk_vid=1f4940f989884d2416737861077985d7: We should consider writing an article as we achieve some progress with our findings.
